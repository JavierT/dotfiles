Just my collection of dotfiles.

Use [Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to install them. Each directory
is a stow package, so you can either install them one by one or all at once,
depending on what you want.

```bash
$ stow `package`
$ stow */  # Install all of them
```

[Stow](http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) can be installed from repositories in
most distributions, or homebrew in Mac.
